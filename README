## The plugin removes featuring artists from the artist field in the ID3 tag.
## the featuring artist is appended to the trackname field.
##
## practical use: Cleans up the arist field , so filtering per main artist is possible again.
##
## Suitable for version:
## Tested on beets version 1.0b11

## preparation:
The following code needs to be placed inside the "__init_.py" file (create one if not present in ~/beets-1.0b11/beetsplug):

from pkgutil import extend_path
__path__ = extend_path(__path__, __name__)

 The code is probably there if you have other plugins installed.

nano ~/.beetsconfig // and add to the plugins line ftInTitle -> plugins = ftInTitle (space separated)
python setup.py install  //for compilation of the plugin into beets
beet ftintitle // run plugin
beet update // should be run after the plugin in order to update the beets database.
